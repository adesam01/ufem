INTRODUCTION

FEM is structural analysis software based on the finite element method.
Software has meant for POSIX-compliant operating environments.

REQUIREMENTS

Solver requires near nothing - ISO/ANSI C89 compliant compiler 
(GCC, for example) and standard system libraries.

User environment (preprocessor) has the same requirements if text-only
interface is used (e.g. without any kind of graphics output or interface).
Graphics version requires additional libraries:

- Gtk+ 2.x.x
- GtkGlExt 1.x
- OpenGL 1.2 implementation (Mesa3D for example)
- gl2ps 1.x (optional)
- libtiff (optional)

INSTALLATION

 1) cd src/
 2) make clean
 3) cd fem ; make all
 4) cd ../tui
 5) make all 
 6) make gfem
 7) su <enter superuser password>
 8) cd ../fem ; make install
 9) cd ../tui ; make install


Notes:

Step 6) is needed only if GUI (graphics user interface) is requested.
Dafault installation directory is "/usr/local" and may be changed
by ediditn of "Makefile" files in "tui" and "fem" (value of the 
INSTALLPATH environment variable).
