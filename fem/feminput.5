.TH FEM INPUT FILE FORMAT "27 May 2008"
.SH SYNOPSIS
This manual describes format of \fBfem\fP input file.
File should include \fBnumbers only\fP. No other characters are allowed.
The description shows also types of numbers: \fB[int]\fP means integer
value (for example 1 or 99 or -21) and \fB[double]\fP means floating-point 
value (for example 1.5 or 1e-3 or -0.122). Lines which are marked as
\fI(repeated)\fP can be used repeatedly (number of repeats depends on 
number of items - it is usualy described by  value which is put on line
before the "repeated" one).
There is also a \fI"preparsed"\fP variant of the input file
(it is used with \fB-p\fP command line parameter for \fBfem(1)\fP).
For this
case the selected identifier values (marked as \fI(P)\fP below) are replaced
with positions of pointed item in their lists (numbered from 0). This version
of input file is produced by the \fBtfem(1)\fP and the \fBgfem(1)\fP.

.SH FILE CONTENTS

.TP
\fBSolution Identifier\fP [int]
Integer number to identify solution.
