Most important:

- NRM speedup for von Mises (skip most of linear part)
- remove MPI code (it's nearly useless)
- orthotropy in element's direction (for timber etc.)
- some kind of (s)hell
- 3D beam refuses to work
- speedup: do not alocate K_e for each element
- heat source loads in nodes (ignored for now)


To Do:

- some constitutive models for masonry (in progress)
- von Mises plasticity (at least) for 2D elements
- make beam element better (element loads etc.)
- more plasticity conditions
- documentation


Sci-Fi:

- speedup optimalizations for linear solution
- 2nd order solution (how to do it?)
- "configure" script
- (alternative) usage of BLAS/LAPACK/PETSc etc.



Fixed:
- data input for dynamics (acceleration only!)
- dynamics (acceleration load only)
- rewrite threads code (fixed?)
- displacement control in non-linear solution
- reading of data from previous results
- include id numbers of element and nodes in the result file
- fix element 005 (slab) - it doesn't work
- remove/change test (and segfault) if there are no boundary conditions
  (usefull for Winkler)
- remove/replace/delete PSEUDO_SEC
- von Mises plasticity (bilinear only, no unloading)
- reactions in MPI solution
- trabecular bone failure conditions
- fix MPI solution (boundary conditions)
- non-linear solution depends on step size?
- SaPo handling during Monte Carlo solution
- divide load and displacement handling to separate functions
- rewrite data acess (femGetMPVal etc.) macros to be more easy to use
- use NRM speedup from MPI in serial version
- add RUN_VERBOSE preprocessor directive
- renumbering of input data:
   - node numbers for elements
	 - node numbers for loads
	 - element numbers for element loads (maybe later)
- math. library
- element localization
- gravitation load
