Solver:
=======

Please see the TODO file in the "fem" subdirectory.



User Interface:
===============

The most important:

- (fdb) mesh: check only sides really connected to other geom. ent.
- (gfx) selections in multiview mode
- (gfx) incorrect orientation of results on 3D links
- (fdb) export/reading of multiple load steps
- (fdb) finish APDL export
- (gfx) near infinite size of reactions if absolute values are < 1.0
- (gui) menu and dialogs for time nodes/load steps


To Do:

- (fdb) import of multiple forces in one node from *.fem
- (fdb) command log needs to be fflushed (!?)
- (fdb) more data testing before solution
- (gfx) infinite size of reactions if no loads are defined
- (gfx) results on beams
- (fdb) enhance mesh generator and line divisions
- (gfx) data size indicator should be hidden if not in use
- (fdb) import of random variables from *.fem


Sci-Fi:

- (fdb) undo/redo function
- (gui) "busy" cursor for all commands - Gtk+-2.0 problem?!
- (gfx) gl2ps for Win32
- (fdb) speedup for meshing, element copying and moving 
- (gfx) finish/correct aspect ratio in box zooming
- (gfx) fix results on 3D links
- (gui) configuration dialogs
- (fdb) export of results to third-party codes: SILO (VisIt)
- (fdb) more geometric entities
- (gfx) optional user-customizable clipping planes
- (   ) threads for time consuming operations
- (   ) "configure" script
- (   ) documentation
- (   ) optional "osmesa.h" (parallel?) off-screen rendering for tfem
- (gfx) antialiasing - check and fix OpenGL settings !!
- (gfx) output to "png" format
- (fdb) DXF (IGES?) geometry import
- (fdb) DXF geometry export


---------------------------------------------------------------------

- (fdb) ksplit, nsplit commands (make two from one)
- (gui) command-line history
- (fdb) ndel,all (ddel,all) codedumps ?!

- (fdb) von Mises stress inside computed results
- (   ) computing/visualisation of custom data (princ. stresses...)
- (   ) full support for element results
- (   ) commands for easy changing of elem/load set
- (fdb) data testing before solution - at least one material must exist
- (gui) dialog box for divisions (no such thing is necessary - mouse added)
- (fdb) time nodes/load steps
